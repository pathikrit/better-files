better-files follows the following release convention `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:
- Change in `PATCH` version: Minor functionality changes (usually bug fix); no public API change. New APIs maybe added
- Change in `MINOR` version: Minor API shape changes (renaming, deprecations) - trivial to modify code to make it compile again; no structural change
- Change in `MAJOR` version: Significant structural and API changes
